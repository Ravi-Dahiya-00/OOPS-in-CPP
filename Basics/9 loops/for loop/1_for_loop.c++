         Loops in C programming are used to repeat a block of code until the specified condition is met.
          It allows programmers to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times without
           writing the code again and again.

                    There are 3 looping statements in C:
                       1. for Loop
                       2. while Loop
                       3. do-while Loop

        // for Loop
          /*
            for loop in C programming is a repetition control structure that allows programmers to write a loop
             that will be executed a specific number of times. It enables programmers to perform n number of
              repetitions in a single line. for loop is entry-controlled loop, which means that the condition
               is checked before the loop's body executes.

                        for (initialization; condition; updation) { 
                                // body of for loop
                            }

                                    Initialization: Initialize the variable to some initial value.

                                    Test Condition: This specifies the test condition. If the condition evaluates to true, then body of the loop
                                     is executed. If evaluated false, loop is terminated.

                                    Update Expression: After the execution loopâ€™s body, this expression increments/decrements the loop variable
                                     by some value.

                                    Body of Loop: Statements to repeat. Generally enclosed inside {} braces.
