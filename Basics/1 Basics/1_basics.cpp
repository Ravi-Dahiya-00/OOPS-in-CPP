Features of C++ :
    1.Simple
    2.Machine Independent
    3.Low-level Access
    4.Fast Execution Speed

** C++ is used in a wide range of applications from game engines and application software to operating systems and embedded systems.

** It supports both low-level and high-level features such as manual memory management and OOPs programming respectively.

** C++ is known as hybrid language because C++ supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms.


✅ Procedural Programming Language:
        A procedural programming language is a type of programming language where the code is organized into procedures or functions.
           These procedures contain a sequence of instructions that the computer follows step by step.

        example: c,go,pascal,basic,FORTRAN

            ✅ Advantages:
                Simple and easy to understand.

                Good for small to medium-sized programs.

                Reusable code using functions.

            ❌ Disadvantages:
                Harder to manage in large, complex systems.

                Not good at modeling real-world entities (unlike OOP).

                Poor data security due to global variables.







✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Language :
        An Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language is a type of programming language that organizes code using objects,
         which are instances of classes. It focuses on real-world modeling, combining data (attributes) and functions (methods) 
         that operate on that data into a single unit — the object.

         example:c++,java,python,c#,Ruby

         Think of a class as a blueprint (like a car design), and an object as the actual car built using that blueprint.





            ✅ Advantages:
                Better code organization

                Reusability through inheritance

                Data security via encapsulation

                Easier to manage large projects

            ❌ Disadvantages:
                Can be more complex to learn initially

                Overhead in performance compared to procedural in some cases
