                    1. The Modulo operator (%) operator should only be used with integers. Other operators can also be
                             used with floating point values.     
                    
                    
                    2. ++a and a++, both are increment operators, however, both are slightly different. In ++a, 
                    the value of the variable is incremented first and then it is used in the program. In a++, 
                    the value of the variable is assigned first and then it is incremented. Similarly happens 
                    for the decrement operator.


                    3. Unary: Works on single operand.
                       Binary: Works on two operands.
                       Ternary: Works on three operands.
