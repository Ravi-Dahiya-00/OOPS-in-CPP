               behaves like a wild pointer and may lead to errors.


               Dangling pointers are a pointers that points to a memory location that has been freed or deleted, 
               leading to undefined behaviour.Accessing it after deletion leads to undefined behavior and security risks.
               This often happens when freeing memory but still using the pointer. Set such pointers to NULL 
               after free() to avoid this issue.
